# The Raven

Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary

Ah, distinctly I remember it really was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow -- vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow -- sorrow for the lost Lenore
From that rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore
Nameless here forevermore

And the silky sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
